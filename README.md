# Real_Estate-UWP
UWP app for a real estate agency (front-end)

------------
This application was developed as part of a student project. It is supposed to be used by some real estate agency as a part of their IT system.

The project has 2 authors: **Dmitry Zhomir** (me) and [**Dmitry Varnakov**](https://github.com/Pixelyzer "Dmitry Varnakov") (the classmate who helped a lot to complete all the tasks listed on our Trello board).

Unfortunately, this app has no functionality at all. The goal was to develop the app's GUI only (navigation included).
